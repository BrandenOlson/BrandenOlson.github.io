     <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington, Seattle. 
<br> <br>
Currently, I am working with Peter Guttorp on statistical modeling of cloud columns and uncertainty assessment for use in general circulation models.
<br> <br>
My research interests include spatiotemporal statistical modeling, statistical climatology, and stochastic weather generation.
