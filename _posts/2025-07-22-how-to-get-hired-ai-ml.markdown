> **TL;DR:** TODO


For years I thought my job security was strong.

I'm blessed to be working in not only the trendiest field today, but in many cases the highest priority as companies race to capitalize on the promises that AI will change everything about modern business.

And yet, lay offs can happen to anyone.

I was recently let go along with the entire AI team. 

I can safely say this was the biggest right turn of my career.


But, this isn't a layoff post.
This is a "how can I turn lemons into AI lemonade" if the time ever comes.

And while job searches are never easy, I enjoyed getting a glimpse of what many AI teams are working on.
And I'm here to share the common themes to help you understand what the market needs, and how you can deliver.

## Core AI / ML themes

These themes surfaced in more than one interview, for totally unrelated AI products.

Treat these as areas where you're likely to be grilled.

- Embeddings as the secret sauce, especially for retrieval but also for data synthesis, etc.
- Agent evals to verify it works as expected
  - I was able to lean on the 3T framework for every. single. interview. Regardless of problem domain or agentic application.
- Error handling
  - How do you handle error situations? Can you use existing knowledge or context to retry intelligently? When should you call it and just return an error?



## Tips and advice

- Document your architectural decisions, especially tradeoffs, and both wins and losses. This is great material to leverage during interviews. Turns out, many other companies are hitting the same hurdles you've hit yourself. 
- Don't just work on tasks, but really understand the systems you're building at a high and low level. Be curious about how things work. Challenge assumptions. Poke at things until they break, then make things unbreakable.
