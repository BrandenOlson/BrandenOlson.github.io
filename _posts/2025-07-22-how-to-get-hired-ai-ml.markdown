> **TL;DR:** In this post I discuss themes I navigated during my recent job search for a new AI / ML role, strategies on what to expect from interviews and real problems companies are dealing with, and targeted advice how to demonstrate your value in an intense job market.


For years I thought my job security was strong.

I'm blessed to be working in not only the trendiest field today, but in many cases the highest priority as companies race to capitalize on the promises that AI will change everything about modern business.

And yet, lay offs can happen to anyone.

I was recently let go along with the entire AI team. 

I can safely say this was the biggest right turn of my career.


But, this isn't a layoff post.
This is a reflection on the current AI / ML market, my experiences with it, and lessons learned that might help others navigate similar situations.

This is a "how can I turn lemons into AI lemonade" if the time ever comes.

And while job searches are never easy, I truly enjoyed getting a glimpse of what many AI teams are working on.
And I'm here to share the common themes to help you understand what the market needs, and how you can deliver.


## 

As someone who hates relinquishing control, I spent a day being shaken, confused, and 


## üìà What the market demands (and why it's changing)


From what I gather, the market wants an AI / ML engineer who can:

- Empathize with user needs
- Translate those needs to a highly effective AI / ML stack
- Give stakeholders (especially yourself) confidence in what you built
- Understand how your AI / ML features solve business problems (+ drive profit!)

These requirements are highly similar to what they've been for the last decade or so, but the emphasis really seems to be on agents, RAG, and evals.
I touch on themes in greater depth in the next section.


## üß† Technical themes you'll be grilled on

These themes surfaced in more than one interview, for totally unrelated AI products.

Treat these as areas where you're likely to be grilled.

- AI systems
  - From ETL, to training, to evaluation, be ready to analyze a problem and propose a sick solution
  - Understand global vs federated learning, and the deep tension of "how do I tailor things per customer?" vs "how do I ensure data privacy + security is completely respected?"
- Embeddings as the secret sauce, especially for retrieval but also for data synthesis, etc.
- Agent evals to verify it works as expected
  - I was able to lean on the 3T framework for every. single. interview. Regardless of problem domain or agentic application.
- Error handling
  - How do you handle error situations? Can you use existing knowledge or context to retry intelligently? When should you call it and just return an error?
- Model selection / tradeoffs
  - Be prepared to give a verbal thesis on simplicity vs accuracy, and especially specific considerations regarding quality, latency, interpretability, cost, etc.

## üß© Don't sleep on the fundamentals

### Leetcode is still alive and kicking

- I was worried being off the grind for so many years would be my demise
- But, as long as you're solving meaningful AI / ML problems, I think you'll naturally have this mindset front and center
- Needless to say, resist the urge to vibe code everything. Understanding your core business logic is non-negotiable.


### Understand modern deep learning, deeply

- Understand attention, and be able to ELI5
  - Better yet, understand its technical and theoretical details, and modern techniques to make it even better
- Understand loss functions (the more the merrier)


### Classical stats / ML isn't dead

- Know your stats fundamentals
  - E.g. confusion matrix quantities
- Know your machine learning fundamentals
- Understand data sampling implications, statistical distributions, unbiasedness, and even experimental design.


## ü¶â Tips and advice

- Document your architectural decisions, especially tradeoffs. Keep track of your wins and losses (and demonstrate what your losses taught you the hard way). This is great material to leverage during interviews. Turns out, many other companies are hitting the same hurdles you've hit yourself.
- Don't just work on tasks, but really understand the systems you're building at a high and low level. Be curious about how things work. Challenge assumptions. Poke at things until they break, then make things unbreakable.


## ü§ù What ultimately led to interviews

It's relatively easy to submit applications you see on LinkedIn, etc., as many as you come across that fit what you're looking for.
But in reality my strongest leads were relationship-driven, whether it was direct outreach, high-signal referrals, or recruiter pings.
It's never been more important to build a rich network, and critically, to maintain it well.
If you can focus on personability, relationship-building, and genuine interest in others, you'll find yourself surrounded my connections who care about you.


## Bonus: What I loved, and would love to see more of, from hiring pipelines

- Hands-on coding tasks
  - My favorite interviews gave me some small amount of "heads up" to gather context before the interview.
  - Think being emailed a doc describing the problem, giving me time to brainstorm before live coding in front of an audience
  - This was genuinely a thrilling experience, so much so that I found myself building on the code well after the interviewer was over :lol:
- Specific expectations per interview round
  - Interviewers, please try your best to convey what a given interview round is assessing at the very beginning
  - E.g., if you're looking for specifics on how to solve agentic tool-routing, don't label it as a "Systems Design" interview.
  - Otherwise, your candidate will waste both of your time talking about service architecture when really you want to discuss agent-internal logic
- Greater efficiency
  - I know recruiting is difficult, especially when you juggle multiple candidates with the schedules of multiple busy stakeholders
  - But, I had to pass up several otherwise very interesting roles simply because time ran out
  - I'm curious how we could speed things along to really get maximum bang-for-buck from a handful of interviews rather than relying on separate signals from the many various stakeholders.
  - More panel interviews might be a good thing here.
  - And recruiters: if a candidate informs you of another offer, please communicate that with the relevant folks ASAP.
  - That way, you give both parties a shot at landing a deal, rather than leading to surprise, confusion, and disappointment.
