<h3 id="-hello-world">👋 Hello, world!</h3>

<h4 id="im-branden-olson-steele-bos--ai-engineer-new-parent-and-coffee-addict">I’m Branden Olson Steele (BOS) – AI engineer, new parent, and coffee addict.</h4>
<p>After working for over a decade at the frontier between research, data science, and AI engineering, I’m finally starting the blog I’ve been meaning to write for, well… over a decade.</p>

<h4 id="elevator-pitch">Elevator pitch</h4>

<p>I build production-grade AI / ML systems, with a recent obsession with agents, GenAI, and LLMs (though I’ll never lose my soft spot for classical statistical models).
I’m an AI generalist who’s architected solutions in diverse domains, whether it’s building fintech agents, trailblazing HR content creation, or publishing new methods in immunology and geostatistics.
Indeed, I’m always drawn to hard, ambiguous problems.
I was lucky to learn from some of the most talented engineers, scientists, and mentors in the world, who helped me see that pressure is a privilege.
Still, I’m humbled every day by how deep this rabbit hole goes.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve wanted to do a lot more writing on AI Engineering topics, but never quite found the time.
However, in the last year, I shipped my biggest career project to date (more on that later), I welcomed my first child to the world (Ada, named after you-know-the-one), and left a Fortune 500 company for a start-up.
It goes without saying that my time has never been a more precious resource.
Naturally, I’ve decided that it’s finally time to start a blog for real.</p>

<h3 id="-goals-of-the-blog">🥅 Goals of the blog</h3>

<p>This blog is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a forum for my thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned in the world of AI Engineering</li>
  <li>a builder’s journal: scrappy, honest, occasionally messy, and always curious</li>
  <li>a reflection of my own experiences and viewpoints (I can be and often am wrong, so don’t quote me 😉)</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog is NOT:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a research blog with journal-tier contributions (though I try my best to apply a research-oriented mindset to AI Engineering)</li>
  <li>a plug or product pitch, though I will unabashedly rave about any tools that make me a happy engineer</li>
  <li>a guarantee of novel ideas - I’ll write about what’s on my mind, and while I’m not claiming all my ideas are original, they’re always hard-won</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="️-why-im-writing">🖊️ Why I’m writing</h3>

<h4 id="reason-1-to-share-my-learnings-with-anyone-else-wanting-to-learn">Reason #1: To share my learnings with anyone else wanting to learn</h4>

<p>I’m extremely fortunate to work in a field at the forefront of human innovation, using cutting-edge technology every day, and sometimes contributing to the state of the art.
And while it’s never been easier to learn, especially about a tech-friendly field like AI, I am hoping my particular career trajectory might offer unique perspectives, and maybe even meaningful insights.</p>

<h4 id="reason--2-to-keep-track-of-things">Reason # 2: To keep track of things</h4>

<p>This field moves FAST.
Paradigm shifts happen in the span of weeks, even days.
It’s truly wild.</p>

<p>Because of this, I sometimes get dizzy trying to keep track of all of the newest models, methods, etc.
Friends or colleagues will ask if I’ve played around with the morning’s release of ThatGPT v-42 and I’m frequently embarrassed to be out of the loop.
Where does anyone find the time?</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’ve always felt that writing is one of the best ways to learn, so why not write about this field as a means of having more informed ideas and opinions on these shiny new gadgets?</p>

<p>Maybe the idea of spending even more time writing on top of reviewing the latest breakthroughs is a bit ironic.
But I’m a firm believer that writing is simply structured, disciplined, critical thinking.
And I think I’d rather spend some time each week doing some disciplined thinking about whatever is top of mind rather than relying on absorbing knowledge solely from nightly cram sessions of all my AI-verse feeds.</p>

<h4 id="reason--3-i-love-to-write">Reason # 3: I love to write</h4>

<p>This is the biggest, most honest reason I’m doing this - I genuinely love writing.
I always have.</p>

<p>Many folks think I went to grad school because I love STEM, but secretly, it’s because I love writing, especially about STEM.</p>

<p>And if I’m being <em>perfectly</em> honest, I do worry that as AI continues to improve and integrate into our lives, I along with most everyone else will write less and less.
I’m hoping that committing to a blog will keep my writing skills sharp, and keep me writing.</p>

<h3 id="-whats-ahead">👀 What’s ahead?</h3>

<p>What’s on the immediate agenda, you ask?
Probably some thoughts on agent architecture, streaming UI headaches, the future of custom model building in a world with increasingly amazing off-the-shelf models, and how it feels to hand control to a system that talks back.</p>

<h3 id="-lets-go">🚀 Let’s go!</h3>

<p>With this in mind, I’m excited to get started!
I hope you find this blog engaging.
I’ll give some thought as to how I’d like folks to interact with my posts, but in the meantime, feel free to message me if you’d like to chat!</p>

<p>So, here’s to writing code that thinks, systems that surprise, and posts that live rent-free in your brain – no tidy conclusion required.</p>

<p>Let’s build. 🛠️</p>

<h3 id="appendix-about-the-name">Appendix: About the name</h3>

<p>My birth surname was Olson, and I changed it to Olson Steele when I got married (my wife’s maiden name was Steele, and her new surname is now also Olson Steele).
Thus, I am now B.O.S., which is some forced serendipity - “B.O. Life” just doesn’t have the same ring to it… 😜</p>
