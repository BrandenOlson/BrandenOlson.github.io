                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                Broadly speaking, my interests lie at the interface of statistics and computer science with an emphasis on stochastic modeling.
                <br> <br>
                Presently, my research involves spatiotemporal statistics and 
                its application to 
                climatology and meteorology, such as developing <a href="http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/weather_generators.html">stochastic weather generators (SWGs)</a>
                and implementing them using fast Markov chain Monte Carlo 
                approaches. 
                I've also taken an interest in contemporary Bayesian methods, particularly 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation">approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)</a> techniques for problems with unknown or intractable likelihoods.
                <br> <br>
                In the past I have also worked on problems in dynamical systems, 
                such as investigating the effect of inhibitory neurons in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">artifical neural networks</a>.
