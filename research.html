     <h2>Research</h2>
     <p class="bio">
     Broadly speaking, my interests lie at the interface of statistics and computer science with an emphasis on stochastic modeling.
     <br> <br>
     More specifically, my research involves spatiotemporal statistics and 
     its application to 
     climatology and meteorology, such as developing <a href="http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/weather_generators.html">stochastic weather generators (SWGs)</a>
     and implementing them using fast Markov chain Monte Carlo 
     approaches. 
     I've also taken an interest in contemporary Bayesian methods, particularly 
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation">approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)</a> techniques for problems with unknown or intractable likelihoods.
    <br> <br>
    In the past I have also worked on problems in dynamical systems, 
    such as investigating the effect of inhibitory neurons in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">artifical neural networks</a>.
    <br> <br>
    Other fields of interest include statistical machine learning, mathematical finance, and data visualization.
